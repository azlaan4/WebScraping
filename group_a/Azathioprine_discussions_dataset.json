Luckily I am fairly stable with the odd flare up now and again. I am being looked after by the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Bham and they are brilliant. Currently im on 50mg of Azathioprine a day and its brilliant with no side effects. I have been on Prednisalone in the past and ive not got on well with it. My doc keeps mentioning the possibility of me having to go back on it in the future but I dont like the  side effects.I am a busy professional who has no time to be poorly, so fingers crossed my Azathioprine continues to do its job!!"

        "discussion": "Hello! I was recently admitted to hospital after visiting my GP with persistant stomach pain (about 2 months on and off) and to cut a long story short, a CT scan showed an inflamed bowel which I was told was most likely down to Crohns diesese. I ened up having a small section of bowel removed by the surgeon, and am now back to normal - e.g. no pain or discomfort what so ever, eating and drinking normally, normal bowel movements... in fact you'd never know I had been ill!\u00a0Now on a follow up at the hospital I have been prescribed Azathioprine tablets. I was given a 30 minute pep-talk by a pharmacist explaining the drug, which if I'm honest terrified me. Risk of cancer, nausea, feeling unwell, reduced bone marrow etc... In fact, lots of very unpleasant side effects. Basically, I feel great right now; 100%, and it sounds like these tablets will make me feel 'not great.' I want to talk to the consultant before I start taking them, but cant get appt until April.From reading posts on the forum, and some general research, it sounds like\u00a0Azathioprine is used to control inflamation during flare ups, or treat chronic Crohns that is affecting quality of life? Yet I have no symptoms, no pain or discomfort, and feel great. I appreciate that Azathioprine can also be used to prevent Crohns from coming back again, but with all the associated risks, and I gather you can only take it for a total of around five years before it stops working, is now the right time for me to be starting this drug? Should it not be held in reserve in case I have problems in the future?Yes, I will be guided by my doctor, but until I can get to see him, I just wanted to get some feedback from anyone else on here using\u00a0Azathioprine. Has anyone been in my position and started taking it? Sorry if I sound like an idiot - I'm feeling very confused and a little concerned about this drug. Do I really want to take something that will make me feel worse than I do now, and possibly even give me cancer? Any feedback greatfully received!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Once off of the drug the reversal of symptons was very quick, most within a day, and now only a couple of days later I feel much better again, and only a very small proportion of the spots remain.In hindsight I can see how ill I became, but at the time I think that mentally I also couldn't function efficiently (conversation and concentration were extremely difficult) making it hard to see how its effect had been gradually worsening as I continued to take the drug.  I think this shows that it's important to remember how side effects can build up gradually and not always appear instantly one or two days after you start a course of treatment.:ill::ill:[i:b921c9e26b]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:b921c9e26b]"

        "discussion": "I am almost 30 and have had ulcerative colitis for 17 years...when I was a teenager, I had a flare up every few weeks and-after countless courses of steroids-which left me riddled with side-effects and unable to live anything even close to a normal teenage life, my doctor put me on Azathioprine 14 years ago. I'm not saying it's been plain sailing, but I truly believe this drug got me through a very stressful undergrad degree at Oxford, a postgraduate degree and every day that I work in my dream job as a broadcast journalist.  Sadly, I have been on the drug so long, the honeymoon is all but over...I can't go out in the sunshine without breaking out in a fierce rash now, too much sunlight makes me so tired I could sleep for hours, I bruise black ad blue every time I sit down too hard and last year I had such severe shingles I still haven't properly recovered. For all that I now feel dizzy and sick most days, I know Azathioprine has given me a very good life these past 15 years. I'm probably going to have to stop taking it...bit would urge anyone deliberating over whether to start, to give it a go...of really is a wonder drug...temporarily at least! Good luck!"

        "discussion": "I have been taking 100mg of azathioprine for a little over a year now following a bad bout of ulcerative colitis, my consultant would like to keep me on it for at least another year.  For the past few weeks I have constantly been feeling unwell.  There are so many viruses going around at the moment and because I have three kids in school, I think that I am catching the viruses or bugs which are around.  I don't ever remember having one infection or virus after another.  Has anyone else, who takes azathioprine had the same problem?:[i:2e8ffec2da]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:2e8ffec2da]"
