Finally I came across XXY syndrome and instantly knew this had to be me, then went to the doctor about it and got diagnosed and got on TRT.But even before I started researching, I was working out to gain a grip on life, to get over depression, low self esteem and get rid of my excess fat on my body. Although I made some gains on my arms and overall body posture, I was never able to get rid of the belly fat and man boobs, even after a slow 3 month calorific deficit cut. I quit working out for 2 years. To this day I still have my man boobs and belly fat. Even though I'm on TRT now and working out my body hasn't changed much. And now that it's already febuary I'm starting to stress out about my body situation for the summer. I do not want to spend another summer anxious and ashamed of my man boobs and belly fat. So I'm wondering.. will liposuction and gynomastia help me? And will they stay like that or will it ever come back again? And can I get it paid for? Because lipo  I heard is around $5,000 and Gyno is around $2,000 and that's a big hit if it's coming out of my pocket. Since its  a syndrome maybe I can get it partially covered? Im living in BC, Canada. Any KS guys go through this before? Anyways... this is a big thing for me. I don't want to pay for it really but if I have to I will.

        "discussion": "I came across KS a while ago on the internet and think my boyfriend (37 yrs old) might have it. He has a lot of the symptoms: no facial hair and sparse body hair, small testes, long legs and short torso, tendancy to put on weight (although he is by no means fat). He has ADHD and depression and has been on meds since he was a teenager. He does, however, have a discernible Adam's apple, a deep voice, and no signs of gynocomastia.\u00a0I haven't told my boyfriend my suspicions as I don't want to hurt his feelings, but I have hinted us going to see a doctor for an exam as we want to start a family soon. But he is reluctant to do so, and I don't want to try for a baby for years before finding out that there is a problem.\u00a0I know that he has had a thyroid test and has even seen a urologist for an unrelated problem. I'm guessing they would have picked up KS if he did have it. Am I worrying for nothing?\u00a0"

All your discussing things that typically a person who has this doesn't really care about like I don't care if it's a disease or syndrome a spectrum either way it sucks at times. The problem is we are not all the same to this disease. If I were to explain from my side things to a future person with this disease you need to some how to stay calm. you will get it and at times will feel like you are mute or no one gets your language, but if keep trying will work out. For you to get things it is going to take a lot but you need to continue to be effective in the sense of trying to learn it and there are multiple things basically things for you might take a little longer. And at times you might have to do it your way to come up with the same result. Test sperm before 16. If there is save it. This syndrome for me is ever hard. Doctors to this day still make me in human and or poke and prod with out concerns for my feelings. I have had to change endocrinologist since moving to fl 7 times. A lot of doctors in our disease is a money maker. And recently since the new HIPAA law things has to be written  so now on paper you are basically dissected on a page. And what I don't like about it is is they listed under a problems category and to me I don't see what I have is a problem.If you have the money to afford not only a tutor I would highly recommend somebody who can work with the individual in social skills. For me the hardest things to digest is that yes I learn slower and yes I look completely different different is not always a bad thing. Being taken out of class was hard. Doctor visits don't really get better, but if you have a good doctor it will not be as bad. I Have A Pectoral chest or a pigeon chest. Growing up was hard, but even with all the things that did not go my way in the end would not change thing. What I have now is quite honestly impressive.  I own a successful business,  I have 3 trucks and a nice family car that has 15k left. My house and everything is paid off. I am only 30. I did all by myself.  So, trust from at very least if you buckle down and get into your niche things will work out monetarily. So, yes things will work out kind of. My present is the happy. For me l,  I felt like everyone was not talking my language and at points I could understand but just could not say it right. School was hard because you to succeed have to have extra time on things and that means that while you are working really hard to learn what most get in a snap takes you 3, 5, 10 more times to just grasp it. You loose out on other things while pulled away. You will at points be okay with leaving class but will hit you with that you are different.  It's okay. I waadequate fun. Of and called stupid to face and behind back by students,  ias,  teachers/ administration.  Doctors office feels like you are an alien.  It is rare after adolescents to find a doctor that has bed side manners. The fact that it takes you longer to learn and how you see self is crippling. Even if makes not effort to say depressed,  most likely he is and doing what I did.... hide from it. I refuse to take therapy. I have done enough re search to question if it is even worth it. I Though Don't Shop The Worst Of it. I will say 100 percent the biggest thing t out need to ensure from when child to.adult no pill fracks with t levels. Because I am not doing therapy,  once t stops, I in trouble.  Right now at 32 I have recently had a weird response that they can not explain. I had a t level a year ago and before level of 230. This year, I havery more stress but my level shot up to 280. It is not fluke because checked 2 times. I have always been low but no one can explain.  School was hard, but people not allowing me to feel normal is the hardest thing. As parents t r not to overly coddle kid and or show them that they are different.  Tell child after 12 what is 60 percent t in store. Do not say without test done if can or not have kids. Leave it as wonder. My li"

There was also a worrying chest lump which thankfully turned out to be an infection. I have also been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, but I am not at all like the majority of aspies.Anyway on confirmation of my suspicions that was a massive weight off my mind, all the questions had an answer so it seemed, but now they don't as my endocrine results do not reveal hypogonadism where the endocrinologist actually said ; My results do not present the usual picture for Klinefelter's Syndrome, yet, I am 47, XXY, which is called Klinefelter's Syndrome, yet I don't have Klinefelter's Syndrome. Asking my GP to explain, she had no idea and even said she knows nothing about XXY and neither the GP before her and so I am left with some rather distressing conditions that I am not confident I am going to get any help with, because I don't fit  ''  the usual picture for Klinefelter's Syndrome of which medical care is available '',  so can someone please explain what is going on, because really this is not doing my mental health much good at all and I really would like to start living at some point.( I have also quested of the various interweb fora concerned with the condition and no one can shine any light on what is going on, an XXY without hypogonadism is unheard of, where I have actually been called a fraud and that does not help either)"

I've read that all people with KS have very small testicles, like 1-10ml, so I feel kinda strange that I have many symptoms, and still the most important symptom I don't have. Also, I'm very hairy, have good beard growth for my age (17) and I am kind of muscular.Can I have KS, even tough my testicles are 25ml each, or do I have any other syndrome?Please answer, because I can't stand feeling this way, and I don't want to go to a doctor (mostly because IF I have it, I wouldn't dare tell it to gf).

My Testoserone level was 25ng/dl when I found out I was XXY. As far as energy level, I've always had three jobs and only sleep an average of 5 hours per night. The doctor then put me on Testosterone and told me I'm going to feel this and that (basically stronger and full of energy). I went through three different regiment systems of getting my Testosterone to increase but it went to about 35ng/dl; still compared to an 80-year old post menopausal woman. When taking the Testosterone, I could no longer walk even a short block; I felt like I'm getting a heart attack. My thigh and leg muscle would feel spastic. I had no energy. Aside from the Testosterone giving me depression I found no reason to take them any longer. I stopped it because mostly it would give me a strong depression. A few months after stopping, my level has gone down to 5ng/dl. The doctor has said the implications of low testosterone is low energy level but my energy level has gone up since I have stopped taking it. I don't feel anymore muscle spasms. I feel much better than when I was taking it. The one thing I have to worry about is Osteoporosis as low levels of Testosterone, as it does in females, cause osteoporosis. For me I would prefer the pain of osteoporosis than not making it to live that long.I'd like to hear what your Testosterone level is and whether Testosterone gives you energy or not.Thank you,Kirk"

Oestrogen is also produced in fat and in muscle, but the testes do the most converting.If the testes are diseased they will not produce sufficient testosterone, there will be less conversion to oestrogen, and it is oestrogen that causes the long bones to stop growing. That is why females are generally shorter than males, they have more oestrogen earlier and their epiphyses (the ends of the bones, where they grow from) stop growing. Females have their growth spurt at the start of puberty and males at the end of puberty, for a very good reason.It takes time for the testes to produce sufficient testosterone to be converted at sufficient rate to cause boys\u2019 long bones to stop growing. XXY boys are then at risk of growing excessively tall because of a disease in their testes called Seminiferous Tubule Dysgenesis.It may be appropriate to give XXY boys additional oestrogen as well as testosterone especially if they don\u2019t have much fat or muscle?Ask your sons\u2019 doctor to think about this."

I learned about my karyotype last year after deciding with my wife that we're ready to have a child. I don't believe that I have the typical physical characteristics of an XXY individual. I am 191cm tall (6'4\") and about 93Kg (about 205 lbs). My testes size, according to the fertility doctor, are of normal size (average like an XY man). I have facial hair and have had it since I was 13-14 years old; I started shaving regularly at 15-16 and ever since then. I sought a famous fertility doctor where I live in San Francisco, California, and he had me undergo a \"Micro-Tese Sperm Retrieval\" but for me and I'm guessing perhaps age and other factors may have played a role in the surgery not being successful.I was born to a family of physicians. My father, a medical doctor, always used to tell me that the circumference of my chest is small compared to other boys or men my age and he used to push me to do exercises to increase my chest and lung capacity until it was of normal XY average. I am not sure if he knew that his son xxy and if he did, I think it was better not to know and striving to be like everybody else would be better for me as an individual than to constantly be sorry and not push myself to do more and blame it on the way I was created.When I was growing up and playing around where my dad worked, at around when I was 15, my dad was examining a patient and drawing spermatozoid out of the patients testicle. He would place the semen on a slide and have me look for sperms. Clueless to own condition I checked my ejaculate and found sperms swimming around. Later when I was in college, there was a sperm bank nearby. I recruited my buddies to give this bank a visit to see if any of us were viable. We all tested positive with decent count. As we did the preliminary sperm count test we never went it to continue to do the genetic testing. Had I done that at age 22, I probably would have frozen some for today.\u00a0It took me a long time to graduate from college. It took me about eight years to get a bachelor's degree in biology. I didn't think of it all that much because most of my other friends also took a long time so I thought it was normal. I remember in college around when I was 27 or so I was working part-time in a laboratory performing research. For school I was taking a class called cell biology. Our final grade was dependent on an experiment we conducted the whole semester and we were to present our results in the form of a presentation for the whole biology department. Unfortunately our experiment cells died and I came up with a clever idea to use my ejaculate, video-tape it at the lab I was working part-time and presenting it for our final project. We aced the final with one comment that the associate dean of the school who was present came to me after the presentation to say he has some words he wants to talk to me about. Me getting extremely nervous said what it is you're concerned about. He told me the cells swimming in our video did not belong to the project experiment. He told me they are spermatozoids. He told me that that was clever and he will let us slide. He told me that when he was in college he did the exact same thing. He shook my hand and asked me who else knows about this. I said nobody. He said let's keep it as such.\u00a0The point I'm trying to make is even if you have a karyotype xxy, regardless of whether you want to call yourself a \"Klinefelter Syndrome\" individual or not, it's never too late to seek a fertility doctor to see if your testes produce sperm or not. It's better if you know way in advance so you can save freeze some for when you're ready to have a child. I am not planning on advertising for any doctor but if you google search best fertility doctor, I'm guessing the one I went to shows up. He has patients from all over the world coming to him. His patients, from what I was told, also have a blog page but I haven't visited it; my wife has.The next point I wanted to get the readers feedback is how do you deal with reading, comprehension, and recall? I had a miserable time in college taking exams! I would get nervous and forget everything even my name. Did any of you had similar situations? I had another class where our teacher's assistant was a single mother of five trying to get her PhD and go to medical school. I would learn the subject at hand, teach her and tell her the highlights before class, and when exam time came in I would be the one with the lowest grade. She would be puzzled with why I graded so low. She knew I know the material but the ability to use that material on the exam would be just hopeless!Thank you Graeme for pointing out a few other association of this karyotype like the testicles being so extremely sensitive. My wife or other women I've been with previous to my wife always wanted to play with my testicles but I had told them that it is forbidden. Another problem I had while having sex was sometimes my testicles would get pulled all the way up out of the scrotal sac into the abdominal area; very painful!Like Graeme, my wife and I have to go through donor insemination (IVF or IUI).I wonder now if there are other ailments that we have that may be associated to this karyotype. I appreciate if readers will be open with their other ailments. For example since I was ten years old, I've always had problems with eating food that has much black pepper. Black pepper and many other foods and beverages cause a constriction in my esophagus. I sometimes think maybe because I've had this ailment since the time of me being very young, it's possible that it's originating from the same variability of that genotype! Who knows? I know it's a long shot but worth checking with you folks.I think I have written much for now.I'm open to discussion or if you need contacts for fertility doctors in the US.Kirk"

If the moderator doesn't like the link he can always delete it and edit the end of my question.Usually it is not ethically correct to find people with disease then refuse to treat them, so why would a survey that is currently being advertised (somewhere) for participants, be ethically correct when half the affected individuals will be given a placebo, but told they're taking testosterone?---The purpose of this study is to determine if testosterone replacement therapy leads to changes in psychological factors and/or motor skills in adolescent males with 47,XXY This study will also evaluate whether certain genetic factors of the X chromosome affect the psychological or motor features of XXY/Klinefelter syndrome.The study will follow half the boys who'll be given testosterone by gel, and the other half a placebo gel, for 12 months.There are no plans stated to evaluate the intelligence or social adaptation of the parents of these boys.

I believe I am the most knowledgeable patient treated for Klinefelter's syndrome in the world.  I certainly know more about it that ALL but 1 of the doctors I have met.  Most doctors haven't got a clue.The information here is old and out of date.  It promotes all the commonly held misconceptions about what KS is, and how it's caused.This is information from a British doctor:\"An unduly pessimistic description of what itmeans to have an extra X or Y chromosome isfrequently given to the parents of an affectedfetus or child by geneticists and paediatriciansbecause the source of their information hasbeen biased towards abnormality...\"Dr Shirley Ratcliffe\"Long term outcome in children of sex chromosome abnormalities\"1999I'd like to influence Patient UK to update it's information about KS, to make it more appropriate and representing the truth.
